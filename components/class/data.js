    class12: `12th Standard - infamously considered the year through which you either make it, or break it!
        Ever since students hit their senior secondary classes, they are made to believe that they are preparing for the end game that is Class 12th. Class 12th board examinations have long been feared by students because of the pressure that comes with the preparation for these exams. Due to this, students do not only push themselves to their limits, but they also undergo a very strong emotional pressure due to this. 
        In all actuality, it’s not only the result that is at stake, but a student’s confidence and emotional well-being too. 
        At Takshila Learning, we inculcate strong concepts and principles in our students through our live online classes. This gives them the much-needed boost to prepare for the examinations and also make them look forward to these final tests. 
        As teachers, we help them prepare for their exams with utmost dedication through our live online classes. At the same time, we also make sure that the time and effort they invest is something that they believe they need to do and not what they should be doing based on society norms. We intend on helping students prepare for the future in terms of managing these pressures, time crunches and their available resources. This helps them prepare themselves not only for their exams, but for all real-life scenarios that they would face at some point in their lives.

    class11: `As students progress towards their final years of school, concepts start increasing in terms of difficulty but also in terms of their importance. 11th standard involves a lot of new concepts since this is the first year wherein students familiarise themselves with their respective streams. It is integral that students receive a detailed understanding of each concept so they don't face difficulties absorbing concepts in class 12. 
        As it is said, if the root stays strong, the tree grows stronger. As such, the importance of class 11 stems from this academic year being a base for class 12. 
        Takshila Learning puts utmost focus on the delivery of these new concepts to the students. Our live classes involve interactive means of learning to facilitate effective learning. Students are encouraged to explore the curriculum extensively by undertaking case studies as a part of the learning material. Our teachers in our live online classes put special emphasis on concept clarity and vigorous practise to ensure that students align with school education and also the pattern of the 12th board

    class1to6: `A kid’s primary years hold utmost importance in their lives. This is because kids undergo massive brain development during these early years. These years hold extreme potential for their fundamental growth. Therefore, it is integral for us, as teachers and parents, to support this crucial development as much as possible.
        The development of the brain is dependent on several factors including a child’s relationships, experiences and learning environment. 
        At Takshila Learning, we work towards inculcating curiosity in the minds of our budding kids to make them keen on learning.
        Takshila Learning’s ideology of learning does not lure the kid to study for an hour only to be followed by an hour of playing. Our ideology focuses on making the study hour as enjoyable as playing for the kids, making the kids want to study instead of asking them to study.
